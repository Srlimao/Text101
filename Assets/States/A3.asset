  storyTitle: 'A3. Emergency Exit '
  storyText: "Okay, you're around the corner. No one can see you. You think.\r\n\r\nBit
    tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machinery. However, in front of
    you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from
    a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry
    it off.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?"
  storyOptions: "1. Pick it.\r\n2. Pry it."
