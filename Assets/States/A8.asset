  storyTitle: 'A8. Evesdropping '
  storyText: "You slink through the machinery towards 2 skanky looking men. The tall,
    scrawny one is carrying an oversized gas-canister-powered arrow shooter, while
    the shorter dumpy man has strapped to him at least a dozen small glass bottles
    with grey liquid inside.\r\n\r\nThe stout fellow finishes cranking a large valve
    (clockwise you notice) and then both men dash off with much haste.\r\n\r\nWhat
    to do?"
  storyOptions: "1. Quick, uncrank that valve, they were clearly up to no good.\r\n2.
    Chase the men."
